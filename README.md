# The C Programming Language
This repository contains code for some of the examples and excircises in the book "The C Programming Language".

It's purpose is for me to practice after I have read the examples, so I only do the ones that I think are fun or will help me.

The code will differ from the book's code because I write them from memory (not copying directly).
